# Advanced-Motion-Light-Management
Manages switches and/or dimmers with motion sensors and other devices such as contact, lux sensors and buttons. 

1. Lux sensitivity: save power avoid turning on the lights when there is enough natural light your home

2. Button capability: 
  
               2.1. hold, tap or double tap a button to pause the app for a specific time duration
  
               2.3. hold, tap or double tap the same button to enable/disable lux sensitivity (app will let you know which commands are left available after you selected the previous one so, for example, if you selected "tapped" as the event that pauses the app, you'll be able to select only "held" or "doubleTapped" as ways to disable/enable lux sensitivity. 
  
3. Contact capability: turn on the lights right when you enter a room so as to not feel any delay between the first motion sensitiviy event and the light turning on. 

4. Dimmer capability: the app will recognize if your switches are dimmers. If so, you'll get to select different values for when a contact is open or closed (works only if you selected a contact). This is very convenient when opening a door accessing a room where a person, like a baby or partner, may be sleeping. This option has the ability to run exclusively under certain location modes.
