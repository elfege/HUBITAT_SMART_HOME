# Thermostat Manager V3: Adaptive and Evolving Climate Control

## Overview

Thermostat Manager V3 is a personal passion project that blends smart home automation with the capabilities of narrow AI. Designed and developed primarily by a single developer, Elfège Leylavergne, it represents countless hours of experimentation, refinement, and problem-solving. While still a work in progress, the app offers a robust and versatile solution for managing your home’s climate intelligently and efficiently.

Thermostat Manager V3 is not just a product; it’s a testament to the ongoing pursuit of creating something smarter, more reliable, and more user-focused. Inputs and ideas from others are welcome.
