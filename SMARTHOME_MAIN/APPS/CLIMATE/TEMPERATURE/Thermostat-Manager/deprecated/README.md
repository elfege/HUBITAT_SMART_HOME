# Thermostat-Manager: The Smart Thermostat App That Learns and Adapts

Thermostat-Manager is an advanced Hubitat app designed to intelligently manage your thermostat settings, learning from your inputs and adapting over time to optimize both energy savings and comfort. This app goes beyond basic scheduling, employing AI and machine learning techniques to understand your preferences and automatically adjust settings based on factors like outside temperature, humidity, and your manual adjustments.

## Key Features

1. **Contact Sensor Integration**: Set rules based on window and door contact sensors to save energy when windows are open and coordinate settings with other thermostats.

2. **Sleep Mode**: Activate personalized sleep settings with the push of a button.

3. **Smart Window Control**: Automatically open windows when weather conditions are favorable to reduce AC usage.

4. **Virtual Dimmer for Temperature Control**: Use a virtual dimmer as a temperature setpoint, allowing the app to learn your preferences and facilitate voice control via Alexa or Google Home.

5. **Intelligent Auto-Mode**: Let the app automatically determine optimal settings based on your learned preferences, current conditions, and customizable min/max thresholds.

6. **Auxiliary Heating and Cooling**: Control supplementary heaters and coolers via switches to boost performance during extreme weather conditions.

7. **Power Consumption Optimization**: When paired with a power-metering switch, the app can prioritize devices and keep total consumption under a set limit based on conditions.

8. **HVAC Health Monitoring**: Detects inconsistencies between power usage and expected state, re-sending commands if needed to overcome potential mesh network issues.

9. **Advanced Fan Circulation Control**: Multiple options to optimize air distribution while cooling.
