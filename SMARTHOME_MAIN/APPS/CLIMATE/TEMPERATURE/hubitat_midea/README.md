# hubitat_midea

This provides Thermostat driver capabilities for Hubitat with Midea branded and Midea-supplied air conditioning units.  Many common brands are supplied by Midea and are compatible with this integration.

This component is substantially based on and is mostly a direct port of this excellent work: <https://github.com/mac-zhou/midea-msmart>

Special thanks to ghgeiger and etienne from the Hubitat forums for their testing and troubleshooting help.
