# Advanced Motion Lighting Management

## 1. General Description of Functionalities

The Advanced Motion Lighting Management is a sophisticated SmartThings app designed to automate lighting based on motion detection, time, modes, and various other conditions. Key functionalities include:

- Motion-activated lighting control
- Time-based and mode-based restrictions
- Dimming and color control for compatible lights
- Illuminance-based lighting decisions
- Button control for app pausing and light toggling
- Contact sensor integration for additional control options
- Override capabilities for manual control
- Watchdog functionality for monitoring hub health
