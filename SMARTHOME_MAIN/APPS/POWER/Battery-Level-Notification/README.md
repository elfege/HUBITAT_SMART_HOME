# Battery-Level-Notification

This app allows you to have all your battery capable devices to report their status on a regular basis. 
It can also report unresponsive devices. 

Your list of devices will appear in the app settings after you installed and ran it or in text and/or audio notifications. 
You can select preset schedules to receive those notifications on a regular basis - when nothing is to be reported, there will be no notification
You can also have your devices checked and polled at regular intervals
If you use chrome speakers integration, this app will attempt to initialize them each time it needs to use them as to compensate for their current unreliability (frequent loss of connection) from hubitat's hub. 

Do not hesitate to report bugs, it always helps, however stupid it may seem.
