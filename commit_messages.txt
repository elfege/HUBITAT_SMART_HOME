fixed bad groovy syntax in resetresetStates method causing state.paused to always return false
bug fixes in SMARTHOME_MAIN/Untitled-1.txt
- Improved Motion Lighting Management V2 override reliability and consistent operation. - Renamed Zooz Q Sensor ZSE11 community driver to Zooz Q Sensor ZSE11 (modified community driver) to better reflect modifications and better version control - Fixed Zooz Q Sensor ZSE11 (modified community driver) BinarySensor and Notification Event handlers that were massacred by my last modifications... resulting in no motion events being reported whatsoever... not sure how I got there! lol
added memoization of switch states, colors and color temperatures to allow for user/other apps override in Advanced_Motion_Lighing_Management_V2.groovy
backup

Commit
 Improve remote backup functionality and UI responsiveness
- fixed currentMode.id error line 474 in Advanced Motion Lighting Management V2 - multiple improvements and bug fixes in Thermostat Manager - Watchdog enhancement: added possibility to control an EzOutlet2 network switch to power cycle a hub when the remote hub is locked (upon failed api call to /hub/reboot) - instead of calling /api/rebootHub as it seems to no longer work (even with proper management token, for some reason).
